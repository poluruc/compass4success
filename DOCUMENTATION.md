# Compass4Success - Project Documentation

*Last Updated: May 16, 2025*

## Project Overview

Compass4Success is a comprehensive iOS application designed for Ontario teachers to manage their classrooms, grades, and assignments. The application is built with Swift and SwiftUI, following modern iOS development practices and specifically targeting the Ontario education system with its curriculum standards and grading systems.

## Key Features

### 1. User Authentication
- Secure login system using JWT/OAuth2
- Token-based authentication with refresh capability
- Role-based access control (Teachers, Administrators)
- Mock authentication for development and testing

### 2. Dashboard
- Personalized welcome screen with teacher information
- Quick stats with key metrics
- Time-range filtering (Week, Month, Semester, Year)
- Animated UI elements for better user experience

### 3. Gradebook Management
- Implementation of Ontario grading standards
- Achievement levels (Level 4, Level 3, Level 2, Level 1, Remedial)
- Detailed grade tracking and analysis
- Performance tracking over time

### 4. Student Management
- Comprehensive student profiles
- Personal and demographic information
- Guardian contact details
- Accommodation tracking
- Enrollment history
- Student performance analytics

### 5. Class Management
- Class creation and tracking
- Student enrollment
- Curriculum mapping
- Schedule management

### 6. Assignment Tracking
- Assignment creation and management
- Cross-class assignment view
- Submission tracking
- Rubric-based grading
- Assignment analytics

### 7. Analytics
- Multi-level analytics (Board, School, Grade, Class, Teacher, Student)
- Performance metrics (Literacy, Numeracy, Science, Social Studies)
- Visualization with charts and graphs
- Data export functionality
- Trend analysis

## Technical Architecture

### App Layer
- Main entry point with authentication state management
- Tab-based navigation with animated transitions
- State management using SwiftUI's native tools (@State, @StateObject, @EnvironmentObject)

### Features Module
- Organized by domain (Authentication, Dashboard, Gradebook, Assignments, Students, Settings)
- Each feature has its own views and view models
- MVVM architecture pattern

### Core Module
- **Models**: Data structures using Realm Objects
  - Student
  - Teacher
  - School
  - SchoolClass
  - Assignment
  - Grade
  - Rubric
  - User
- **Services**: Business logic
  - AuthenticationService
  - AnalyticsService
  - ClassService
  - StudentService
  - MockDataService (for development)
- Utilities and extensions

### UI Layer
- Reusable components
- Consistent styling
- Custom animations
- Adaptive layout for different device sizes

### Persistence
- Realm database for local storage
- Model objects defined as Realm Objects
- Relationships between models

## Technology Stack

- **Swift 5.7+**: Main programming language
- **SwiftUI**: UI framework
- **iOS 16.0+**: Target platform
- **Combine**: Reactive programming framework
- **Realm**: Local database
- **JWTDecode**: Authentication token handling
- **Charts**: Data visualization

## Development Workflow

### Building the Project
- Xcode 14.0+ required
- Dependencies managed via Swift Package Manager
- Development, Staging, and Production environments

### Testing
- Unit tests for core business logic
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Mock services for testing without backend connectivity

### Deployment
- TestFlight for beta testing
- App Store for production releases

## Integration Points

- Ontario Education System API (planned/in development)
- School Information System integration
- Export to standardized formats (CSV, PDF)

## Current Status and Roadmap

### Current Status
- Core functionality implemented
- UI framework established
- Mock data services in place for development
- Local persistence with Realm

### Short-term Roadmap
- Complete backend API integration
- Enhanced analytics features
- Offline mode improvements
- Performance optimizations

### Long-term Roadmap
- Parent/Guardian portal
- Advanced reporting features
- Machine learning for personalized learning insights
- Integration with additional educational tools and services

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Currently using mock data for development
- Some analytics features may be performance-intensive on older devices
- Limited support for accessibility features (in progress)
