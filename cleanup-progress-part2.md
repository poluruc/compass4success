# Compass4Success Cleanup Progress - Part 2

## Issues Fixed

1. **Student Model & StudentView Issues**
   - Added missing `status` property to Student through extension in StudentsViewModel.swift
   - Leveraged existing `averageGrade` and `completedAssignments` properties from GradebookViewModel.swift
   - Added `totalAssignments` property as an alias for `assignmentCount`

2. **ClassService Issues**
   - Fixed corrupted ClassService.swift file by restoring proper enum definition
   - Class alias already properly defined as `typealias Class = SchoolClass`

3. **AnalyticsService Issues**
   - Removed circular dependency import of Compass4Success
   - Fixed method parameter naming from `for class: SchoolClass` to `for schoolClass: SchoolClass`
   - Updated all references to use `schoolClass` instead of backtick-escaped `class`

4. **TeacherAnalytics Model Issue**
   - Added missing `objectiveCompletionRate` property with default value for backward compatibility

5. **AssignmentCard Redeclaration**
   - Renamed AssignmentCard in DashboardView.swift to DashboardAssignmentCard
   - Updated references in ForEach loop to use the new DashboardAssignmentCard

## Testing Conducted

Applied the changes one by one with careful validation between each step.

## Remaining Issues

1. **Submission.swift/SubmissionExport Initializer** - May need to be addressed with further files check
2. **AnalyticsPreviewProvider Issues** - Potential unresolved school reference issues

## Next Actions

1. Run a build to validate fixes
2. Fix any remaining compilation errors found during build
