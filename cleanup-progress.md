# Compass4Success Cleanup Progress

## Completed
- Updated AnalyticsView.swift to remove duplicate chart components
- Created SubjectPerformanceChart.swift in the Components directory
- Fixed ClassAnalyticsViewV2.swift to use UIKit import
- Renamed StatCard to ClassStatCard in ClassAnalyticsViewV2.swift
- Made AddStudentView initializer public
- Added typealias Class = SchoolClass in ClassService.swift
- Created documentation for chart components
- Fixed TeacherAnalyticsView.swift - Removed reference to non-existent objectiveCompletionRate property

## Still to Fix
- Submission.swift - Fix SubmissionExport initializer
- AnalyticsPreviewProvider - Fix school reference and ClassService reference
- AnalyticsService.swift - Fix ClassService reference
- GradebookViewModel.swift - Fix ClassService reference 
- MockDataService.swift - Fix School assignment to LinkingObjects
- DashboardView.swift - Fix AssignmentCard redeclaration

## Notes
- We may need to adjust model definitions to ensure proper compatibility
- Some references to ClassService may require the full path
- The SchoolClass model's school property is a LinkingObjects type which requires different handling than a direct assignment
