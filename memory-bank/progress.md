### In Progress Fixes

- 🔄 Resolving model redeclaration issues
- 🔄 Fixing Codable conformance in model classes
- 🔄 Addressing generic type inference issues
- 🔄 Creating more fallback non-Chart visualizations for macOS 12.0

## Known Issues

- ❌ Chart framework not available before macOS 13.0
- ❌ Duplicate view implementations in AnalyticsView.swift
- ❌ UIKit-specific code in shareFile function not compatible with macOS
- ❌ Missing Grade model causes compilation errors in Submission.swift
- ~~❌ Student model has conflicting totalAssignments property definitions~~ (FIXED)

### Critical Build Issues

- ❌ Model definition errors
  - ~~Redeclaration of 'totalAssignments' in Student.swift~~ (FIXED)
  - ~~Missing 'Grade' type definition needed by Submission.swift~~ (FIXED) 
  - ~~Codable conformance issues in Submission class~~ (FIXED)
  - ~~Relationship binding errors in SchoolClass and related models~~ (FIXED)

- ❌ UI compatibility issues
  - ~~"Expected expression" errors in complex ForEach loops~~ (FIXED)
  - Type-checking timeout errors in nested view structures
  - Generic parameter inference failures in collection views

- ❌ Swift compiler errors
  - Reserved keyword 'class' used as variable name in multiple files
  - Missing @available attributes for platform-specific APIs
  - Parameter type mismatches in cross-platform code
  - Type inference failures in generic contexts

### Performance & UI Issues

- ⚠️ Performance degradation with large datasets
- ⚠️ UI rendering issues on smaller devices
- ⚠️ Memory usage spikes during analytics calculations
- ⚠️ Occasional Realm threading issues
- ⚠️ Animation stuttering on older devices

### Platform Compatibility

- ⚠️ SwiftUI Color system differences between iOS and macOS
- ⚠️ API availability differences requiring @available attributes
- ⚠️ Different navigation patterns between platforms
- ⚠️ Chart component compatibility issues across platforms

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architectural Changes

- **Initial**: MVC pattern considered
- **Evolution**: Shifted to MVVM for better state management and testing
- **Current**: MVVM with Combine for reactive programming

### Database Decisions

- **Initial**: CoreData considered
- **Evolution**: Evaluated Firebase and SQLite options
- **Current**: Realm selected for offline-first capability and simplicity

### UI Framework Decisions

- **Initial**: UIKit with programmatic UI
- **Evolution**: Mixed UIKit/SwiftUI approach considered
- **Current**: Full SwiftUI implementation for modern iOS features

### Testing Approach

- **Initial**: Minimal testing planned
- **Evolution**: Unit tests added for core services
- **Current**: Comprehensive testing strategy including UI and performance tests

This progress document outlines what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions for the Compass4Success application.

# Recent Fixes

- Refactored complex nested views to improve build times and eliminate type-checking timeouts
  - Extracted chart components into their own view structs
  - Moved data rendering to dedicated view components
  - Used typealias to replace original views with refactored versions
  - Added explicit type annotations to resolve generic parameter inference

- Created specialized components for better code organization:
  - ClassPerformanceChart
  - SubjectPerformanceChart
  - TeacherPerformanceChart
  - StudentProgressChart
  - DemographicMetricsView
  - PerformanceMetricsView
  - ResourceUtilizationView
  - GradeLevelStatsView
  - SemesterPickerView

- Added explicit type annotations to List views:
  - Updated ForEach loops in PickerSheets.swift with explicit types
  - Fixed SchoolClass vs Class typealias usage in CrossClassAssignmentView.swift

# Remaining Issues

- Continue identifying and breaking down complex nested view structures
- Add cross-platform compatibility checks where needed
- Add fallback views for iOS 16.0+ and macOS 12.0+ compatibility
- Verify all Chart-based UI components have non-Chart alternatives for older platforms

# Next Steps

- Finalize verification of builds across all target platforms
- Create test suite for refactored components
- Conduct performance testing to verify improvements in build times
- Create documentation for the component architecture
