# Active Context

*Last Updated: May 22, 2025*

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in fixing the compilation errors in the Compass4Success application. The key fixes include:

1. **Model Relationship Fixes**:
   - Fixed SchoolClass-School relationship by correctly implementing LinkingObjects
   - Added missing properties to analytics models for backward compatibility
   - Resolved circular dependencies between model imports

2. **Duplicate Property Resolution**:
   - Removed duplicate property definitions in Student model extensions
   - Fixed computed property conflicts including `totalAssignments`
   - Added missing `status` property to Student through extension in StudentsViewModel.swift

3. **New Implementation**:
   - Created a complete GradeLevelAnalyticsView with charts and visualizations
   - Implemented helper components for metrics visualization
   - Added `SchoolYearHelper` utility and year tracking system

## Remaining Issues

1. **Project Structure Issue**: There appears to be a mismatch between the Swift Package Manager structure and the Xcode project structure, causing build errors like:
   ```
   error: couldn't build /Users/poluruc/chandra/work/cline/compass4success/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/Compass4Success.build/PickerSheets.swift.o because of multiple producers
   ```

2. **Path Issues**: The Xcode project appears to be located inside a subdirectory (`/Users/poluruc/chandra/work/cline/compass4success/Compass4Success/Compass4Success.xcodeproj`), but some commands are attempting to find it at the root level.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues**:
   - Some UI components still requiring platform-specific implementation
   - Platform-specific color handling needs further refinement
   - Some chart components still need fallback views for older OS versions

## Next Steps

## Current Work Focus

The development team is currently focused on:

1. **HIGH PRIORITY: Addressing remaining cross-platform compatibility issues**
2. **HIGH PRIORITY: Implementing comprehensive fallback views for Chart components**
3. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Resolving project structure and build system issues**
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Completing SchoolYear tracking system**
5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Enhancing performance for complex analytics features**

## Recent Changes

- **API Naming Convention Fixes**: Updated method parameter naming from `for class: SchoolClass` to `for schoolClass: SchoolClass`
- **Cross-Platform ColorHelper Enhancement**: Expanded platform-specific color handling
- **Component Renaming**: Renamed AssignmentCard in DashboardView to DashboardAssignmentCard to avoid conflicts
- **Student Model Enhancement**: Fixed status property and totalAssignments computed property
- **TeacherAnalytics Model**: Added missing `objectiveCompletionRate` property
- **SchoolYear Tracking**: Implemented school year tracking across Board, School, and SchoolClass models
- **RubricPickerView Compilation Error**: Fixed ForEach generic parameter inference error in RubricPickerView.swift at line 179
  - Made `RubricTemplateLevel` conform to `Identifiable` protocol with `id` computed property based on `level`
  - Fixed property access from `level.description` to `level.rubricTemplateLevelDescription` to match actual model property name
  - This resolves the type conversion issue from [RubricTemplateLevel] to expected Binding<C> in ForEach loop

## Next Steps

### Recently Completed Tasks

- ✅ Fixed missing `curriculumCoverageRate` property in TeacherAnalytics model
- ✅ Added missing `objectiveCompletionRate` property to TeacherAnalytics
- ✅ Removed circular dependency import of Compass4Success in AnalyticsService
- ✅ Fixed method parameter naming from `for class: SchoolClass` to `for schoolClass: SchoolClass`
- ✅ Added missing `status` property to Student through extension
- ✅ Renamed AssignmentCard to DashboardAssignmentCard to avoid conflicts
- ✅ Implemented school year tracking system with `SchoolYearHelper` utility

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Fix Project Structure Issues**:
   - ⬜ Resolve Swift Package Manager and Xcode project integration
   - ⬜ Fix "multiple producers" error in build process
   - ⬜ Ensure proper path references in build commands

2. **Complete Cross-Platform Support**:
   - ⬜ Implement fallback views for all Chart components for older OS versions
   - ⬜ Enhance ColorHelper to handle all system color variations
   - ⬜ Update any remaining platform-specific UI components

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - ⬜ Optimize complex ForEach loops with explicit type annotations
   - ⬜ Reduce view hierarchy depth for better compile times
   - ⬜ Implement lazy loading for analytics data

### School Year System Enhancement
- Complete SchoolYear picker component
- Implement academic year filtering across all analytics views
- Add year-over-year comparison features

### Upcoming Features

- Parent/guardian portal access
- Integration with Ontario Student Information System
- Push notifications for grade updates
- Offline synchronization improvements
- Enhanced export functionality for reports

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Project Structure Review**: Determining best approach for Swift Package Manager vs Xcode project integration
- **Performance vs. Feature Tradeoff**: Balancing new features with app performance
- **Analytics Depth**: Determining appropriate level of detail for analytics views
- **Testing Strategy**: Developing comprehensive test plan for critical functions
- **UI Refinement**: Considering design updates for better accessibility
- **Cross-Platform UI Strategy**: Finalizing approach for consistent UI across iOS and macOS

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Cross-Platform Coding Requirements

- **ALWAYS** use @available(macOS 13.0, iOS 16.0, *) for APIs not available on older macOS versions
- **ALWAYS** use #if os(iOS) / #else for platform-specific UI components
- **NEVER** use Color.systemBackground directly, use ColorHelper instead
- **NEVER** use 'class' as a variable name, use 'schoolClass' instead
- **ALWAYS** specify explicit id: \.self in ForEach loops
- **ALWAYS** implement ObservableObject protocol in ViewModels
- **AVOID** deeply nested view structures that cause type-checking timeouts
- **USE** platform-specific imports for UIKit and AppKit when needed

### UI/UX Principles

- Consistent use of animations for state transitions
- Information hierarchy in complex views
- Progressive disclosure of complex functionality
- Accessibility as a core design principle

### Development Workflow

- Feature branch workflow with code reviews
- Unit tests required for services
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Documentation updates with code changes

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Build Error Insights

- SwiftUI Chart components require macOS 13.0+ but project targets macOS 13.0+
- Type checking in SwiftUI fails silently until build time
- ForEach loops need explicit id parameters to avoid type inference issues
- Using Swift keywords as variable names causes cryptic compiler errors
- Realm property wrappers require careful usage with Codable conformance
- Swift's type inference has limits with deeply nested generic types
- @available attributes must be added to every view in the hierarchy using newer APIs

### Cross-Platform Insights

- System colors work differently between iOS and macOS
- Navigation patterns must be tailored to each platform
- macOS 12 vs 13 has significant SwiftUI API differences
- UI controls need platform-specific sizing and styling
- Type checking complexity increases dramatically with cross-platform code
