# Active Context

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in fixing the compilation errors in the Compass4Success application. The key fixes include:

1. **Model Relationship Fixes**:
   - Fixed SchoolClass-School relationship by correctly implementing LinkingObjects
   - Added missing properties to analytics models for backward compatibility
   - Resolved circular dependencies between model imports

2. **Duplicate Property Resolution**:
   - Removed duplicate property definitions in Student model extensions
   - Fixed computed property conflicts

3. **New Implementation**:
   - Created a complete GradeLevelAnalyticsView with charts and visualizations
   - Implemented helper components for metrics visualization

## Remaining Issues

1. **Project Structure Issue**: There appears to be a mismatch between the Swift Package Manager structure and the Xcode project structure, causing build errors like:
   ```
   error: couldn't build /Users/poluruc/chandra/work/cline/compass4success/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/Compass4Success.build/PickerSheets.swift.o because of multiple producers
   ```

2. **Path Issues**: The Xcode project appears to be located inside a subdirectory (`/Users/poluruc/chandra/work/cline/compass4success/Compass4Success/Compass4Success.xcodeproj`), but some commands are attempting to find it at the root level.

## Next Steps

## Current Work Focus

The development team is currently focused on:

1. **URGENT: Fixing critical build errors blocking compilation**
2. **HIGH PRIORITY: Addressing cross-platform compatibility issues**
3. **HIGH PRIORITY: Resolving model definition and relationship errors**
4. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Fixing UI component rendering issues**
5. **MEDIUM PRIORITY: Addressing Chart compatibility problems**

## Recent Changes

- **Significant Refactoring**: Completed major refactoring of complex view structures to fix type-checking timeouts
- **Component Extraction**: Created multiple dedicated components for chart and data visualization
- **Type Annotations**: Added explicit type annotations to all List views and ForEach loops
- **Type-Safe References**: Improved Class vs SchoolClass references to avoid ambiguity
- **View Simplification**: Reduced nesting depth in complex analytics views

## Next Steps

### Recently Completed Tasks

- ✅ Fixed missing `curriculumCoverageRate` property in TeacherAnalytics model
- ✅ Resolved SchoolAnalytics initialization issues in MockDataService
- ✅ Fixed SchoolClass-School relationship implementation
- ✅ Removed circular dependencies between model imports
- ✅ Created GradeLevelAnalyticsView implementation with chart components
- ✅ Fixed Student model property duplication issues

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Fix Project Structure Issues**:
   - ⬜ Resolve Swift Package Manager and Xcode project integration
   - ⬜ Fix "multiple producers" error in build process
   - ⬜ Ensure proper path references in build commands

2. **Continue Model and Relationship Fixes**:
   - ⬜ Review and fix any remaining circular dependencies
   - ⬜ Ensure all property wrappers are used correctly with Realm
   - ⬜ Validate SchoolClass-School bidirectional relationship works properly

3. **Analytics Implementation**:
   - ⬜ Test GradeLevelAnalyticsView with sample data
   - ⬜ Implement any missing analytics views
   - ⬜ Ensure cross-platform compatibility of chart components

### Cross-Platform Fixes
- Continue creating fallback views for Chart visualizations for macOS 13.0
- Enhance platform-specific utilities in ColorHelper

### Upcoming Features

- Parent/guardian portal access
- Integration with Ontario Student Information System
- Push notifications for grade updates
- Offline synchronization improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **API Design**: Finalizing backend API specifications
- **Performance vs. Feature Tradeoff**: Balancing new features with app performance
- **Analytics Depth**: Determining appropriate level of detail for analytics views
- **Testing Strategy**: Developing comprehensive test plan for critical functions
- **UI Refinement**: Considering design updates for better accessibility

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Cross-Platform Coding Requirements

- **ALWAYS** use @available(macOS 13.0, iOS 16.0, *) for APIs not available on older macOS versions
- **ALWAYS** use #if os(iOS) / #else for platform-specific UI components
- **NEVER** use Color.systemBackground directly, use ColorHelper instead
- **NEVER** use 'class' as a variable name, use 'schoolClass' instead
- **ALWAYS** specify explicit id: \.self in ForEach loops
- **ALWAYS** implement ObservableObject protocol in ViewModels
- **AVOID** deeply nested view structures that cause type-checking timeouts
- **USE** platform-specific imports for UIKit and AppKit when needed

### UI/UX Principles

- Consistent use of animations for state transitions
- Information hierarchy in complex views
- Progressive disclosure of complex functionality
- Accessibility as a core design principle

### Development Workflow

- Feature branch workflow with code reviews
- Unit tests required for services
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Documentation updates with code changes

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Build Error Insights

- SwiftUI Chart components require macOS 13.0+ but project targets macOS 13.0+
- Type checking in SwiftUI fails silently until build time
- ForEach loops need explicit id parameters to avoid type inference issues
- Using Swift keywords as variable names causes cryptic compiler errors
- Realm property wrappers require careful usage with Codable conformance
- Swift's type inference has limits with deeply nested generic types
- @available attributes must be added to every view in the hierarchy using newer APIs

### Cross-Platform Insights

- System colors work differently between iOS and macOS
- Navigation patterns must be tailored to each platform
- macOS 12 vs 13 has significant SwiftUI API differences
- UI controls need platform-specific sizing and styling
- Type checking complexity increases dramatically with cross-platform code
